    <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
        <li>3/4 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1(28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2(6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>2(6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Ingredients: </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 chicken thights</li>
        <li>6 chicken drumsticks</li>
        <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Buffalo Hot sauce(optional)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pepper</li>
        <h4>Dredging Mixture: </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons onion powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together buttermilk, hot sauce (optional, for added flavor), salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl. Add in chicken pieces. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 hours.</li>
        <li>When ready to cook, pour the vegetable oil in a skillet until it is about 3/4 inch deep. Heat to 350 degrees.
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the breading by combining the flour, cornstarch, onion powder, garlic powder, oregano, basil, white pepper, cayenne pepper, paprika, and salt in a gallon sized resealable plastic bag or shallow dish. Mix it thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Working one at a time, remove chicken pieces from buttermilk mixture. Shake it gently to remove the excess. Place it in the breading mix and coat thoroughly. Tap off the excess.</li>
        <li>Place the breaded chicken into the 350 degree oil. Fry 3 or 4 pieces at a time. The chicken will drop the temperature of the oil so keep it as close to 350 degrees as possible. Fry each piece for 14 minutes, turning each piece about half way through, until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165 degrees F. </li>
        <li>Remove from the oil and place on paper towels. Let them rest for at least 10 minutes before serving. </li>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground meat</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup(130 grams) chopped onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>Pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1 cup water, broth or dry red wine</li>
        <li>1(28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>

        <li>12 ounces dried spaghetti or favorite pasta shape</li>
        <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions: </h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.</li>

        <li>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, stirring continuously for about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt, and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook, uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly (see notes for suggestions).</li>
        <h4>Cook Spaghetti</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions, but check for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>To Finish</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta, and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on top.</li>
        </ol>
